## Problem Definition
### State the initial general problem and refined specific problem statement
Initial General Problem: Wildfires are a growing environmental hazard that threaten ecosystems, human populations, and air quality, making it important to understand the conditions that influence their severity.

Refined Specific Problem: This project investigates how variation in environmental and meteorological conditions, specifically temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and drought-related fire weather indices, are associated with differences in wildfire severity, measured by burned area. It aims to identify which combinations of these conditions are most strongly linked to larger, more severe wildfire events, and to better understand how these factors interact to influence the scale of fires.

Refinement Rationale: The initial problem of understanding wildfire behavior is broad and difficult to analyze directly, as wildfire severity is influenced by many complex and often unobserved factors. By refining the problem to focus specifically on how environmental and meteorological conditions relate to burned area, the analysis becomes more targeted and measurable. Burned area provides a continuous indicator of wildfire severity, allowing for meaningful comparisons across events. Additionally, narrowing the focus to variables such as temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, and drought-related indices leverages the available data while concentrating on factors that are theoretically linked to fire spread. This refinement allows the analysis to move beyond general description and instead examine how variation in these conditions corresponds to differences in wildfire severity.

Project Motivation: Understanding the environmental conditions associated with more severe wildfires is important for improving risk assessment and informing prevention and response strategies. As climate patterns shift and extreme weather events become more frequent, identifying how factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, and drought conditions relate to wildfire severity can help highlight situations where fires are more likely to grow large and cause greater damage. Beyond its environmental relevance, this project also demonstrates how data can be used to study complex, real-world phenomena, where outcomes are influenced by many interacting factors and may not be easily predictable. By analyzing these relationships, this project contributes to a broader effort to better understand and manage wildfire risk.

### Domain Explanation
This project lies within the domain of environmental data science and wildfire prediction. Wildfires are complex natural events influenced by a wide range of environmental conditions. Researchers and environmental agencies use meteorological and ecological data to better understand the conditions that contribute to wildfire occurrence and severity. The Forest Fires dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains records of wildfire events in Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal along with weather conditions and drought indicators collected at the time of each fire. By analyzing relationships between environmental variables and burned area, researchers can identify patterns that may help improve wildfire risk assessment and environmental management strategies.

## Data Creation
### Raw Data Acquisition Process (Provenance)
The dataset used in my analysis is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Forest Fires dataset. This dataset contains observations of wildfire events in a forested region in Northeast Portugal, and includes spatial coordinates, temporal variables (month and day), environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, and rain), and fire-related indices (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI), along with the burned area. The data was downloaded from the UCI repository as a compressed ZIP file, which was then unzipped to extract the CSV file. After loading the dataset, I examined its structure briefly through excel and found that the dataset was already well-structured, limiting the need for any major preprocessing. The final dataset is organized as a single table, where each row represents an observation of wildfire conditions and the associated burned area.

### Bias Identification
Bias may be introduced into the Forest Fires dataset through several aspects of the data collection process. First, the dataset is limited to a specific geographic region (the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal), which introduces a form of sampling bias. The environmental and wildfire patterns observed may not generalize to other regions with different climates or vegetation.

Second, the dataset uses spatial coordinates (X and Y) based on a grid system rather than precise geographic latitude and longitude. This basically pixelates the data, where instead of capturing the exact location of each fire, observations are grouped into grid cells. This could possibly lead to multiple fires occurring in different parts of the same grid cell being treated as a single observation, which results in a loss of detail and obscurity of local variation.

Lastly, there may be survivorship bias, as the dataset likely includes only recorded wildfire events. Smaller or less significant fires may be underrepresented, while larger or more impactful fires are more likely to be captured in the data.

### Bias Mitigation
Each type of bias mentioned requires its own unique solution. To account for geographic sampling bias, conclusions should be limited to the Montesinho Natural Park region (or regions with very similar geographic features/climate) rather than generalized broadly. To generalize further, we would have to collect more data from other regions.

To mitigate spatial resolution bias introduced by the grid-based (X and Y) system, analysis should focus on aggregated trends rather than precise location-based conclusions. For example, grouping observations by larger patterns (such as overall fire frequency or average burned area) helps reduce the impact of the “pixelation” effect and avoids overinterpreting small spatial differences.

Finally, survivorship bias can be accounted for by acknowledging that the dataset may underrepresent smaller fires. Analyses should avoid assuming that the dataset reflects all wildfire activity and instead interpret results as representative of recorded events, which may skew toward larger or more easily detected fires. This is an example of bias that would have to be documented as a source of uncertainty.

### Rationale for critical decisions
Several key decisions were made in selecting the Forest Fires dataset for my analysis. I chose to use the dataset without attempting to alter or correct inherent limitations. Certain characteristics are fundamental to how the data was collected and cannot be meaningfully reconstructed at a finer level of detail without redesign the collecting process and starting from scratch.

The survivorship bias specifically presents a limitation that cannot be directly corrected. Rather than attempting to adjust for this, the approach I have decided to take is to explicitly acknowledge this limitation and interpret results as reflecting observed and recorded fires, rather than all fire activity. Transparency is key to moving forward even when the data may have inherent bias.

Similarly, the use of grid-based coordinates introduces uncertainty by obscuring detailed spatial variation. Because of this, I made the decision to focus on broader patterns and relationships in the data, which are more robust to this type of spatial uncertainty. Overall, the primary strategy for handling uncertainty in this project is not to eliminate it, but to clearly document, acknowledge, and account for it in the interpretation of results.
